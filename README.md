A application I created to *somewhat* replicate JARVIS from Iron Man.  The goal of this project was to create a application that can do basic tasts:

fetch weather
cmd scripts
etc

My focus on this was automation, and a "plugin" system where you could add other jar files that would be dynamically added at runtime.7
